<h2>Name:<br></h2>

<h3>Nicholas Aksanov<br></h3>

I am a student in my first year at the University of Rhode Island. I am 21 years old and from Lincoln, RI. I have been serving in the U.S Air Force in Cyber Defense Systems Operations for slightly over 2 and a half years. I plan on graduating from the URI Computer Science B.S program and commission after I receive my bachelors. Some other things about me are that I am fluent in Russian as both of my parents are from Russia, and I have been competitively fencing for over 10 years all across tournaments throughout New England. Additionally I have been playing piano for almost 10 years as well and performed at many different musical concerts and recitals.
